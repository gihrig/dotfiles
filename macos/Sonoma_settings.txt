			In macOS Sonoma with dual monitors:
			 System Settings > Zoom > Zoom style > Advanced > Appearance >
			   Zoomed image moves > When Pointer Reaches Edge
			   behaves as "Near screen edge".
		    Is there a way to correct this and prevent
			the zoomed screen image from moving until the pointer actually reaches the screen edge?
